This project is part of a bigger project: vot.e App designed for diploma purposes;

vot.e App is designed to be a three-part app known as microservice architecture as follows:

    vot.e backend -> The core app which stores the data and executes voting processes (simulations)
    vot.e frontend -> The ADMIN user interface, accessible only via ADMIN accounts
    vot.e mobile app -> The mobile App

::: vot.e frontend --> ADMIN UI :::

This app handles all data in the core app *vote.e backend* and exposes this to port 4090 (check more for spring cloud).

this is ADMIN UI!
